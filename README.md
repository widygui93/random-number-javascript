# About
This is a simple web about random number which is written in javascript DOM. I create it after learning the basic javascript DOM and try to implemented it.

There is a table with 20 numbers which will be choose randomly after clicking Play button. The table below is user's table contains 10 numbers which are taken randomly from the above table. The numbers in user's table can contain same number. If clicking play button , it will chose a number randomly from 20 numbers. Then program (script.js) will check whether the random number is also the number in user's table or not. User have 18 chances to click button play. If all the number in user's table are chosen , user will win. If it is not after 18 chances, user will lose. The random number which have choosen will not be choosen anymore. So the 18 chances is pure for the numbers which have not been choosen. The reset button is just for reload the page. The web is also written in bootstrap framework so the web will be responsive with the size of browser just like the display in mobile size.
